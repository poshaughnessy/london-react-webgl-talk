## London React: Combining React and WebGL for 2D & 3D Web Apps

I started developing my slides as an actual React web app (it would have been nice to have the demos embedded in the slides) but ended up running out of time, so I simply used Google Presentations.

[Here's the link to the final slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1moVaB4nnSRyHO53Ic8TPbTTX-M8P1OtLgcdkVejd8o4/edit?usp=sharing).

I'm leaving this here unfinished in case it's useful for another time.


### Instructions

    npm install   
    gulp
